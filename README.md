# MY SAMPLE WITH DESIGN CONCEPTS LEARNED SO FAR

# Layouts
## 1 - Custom filter layout with animations

I tried to implement the layout from the following Medium article by @nikhilpanju: https://medium.com/proandroiddev/complex-ui-animations-on-android-featuring-motionlayout-aa82d83b8660 on my own.

During the implementation, whenever I encountered difficulties, I referred to his repository so that I could understand the differences and learn from them.

I attempted to implement the same animation twice, first using "low-level of abstraction" techniques, and secondly, using motion layout.

## 2 - Motion layout

I learned some motion layout basics to understand the idea of applying these kinds of animations.

## 3 - Parallax demonstration

# Building

The building process is pretty straightforward, just like any other Android App ðŸ˜Š.
