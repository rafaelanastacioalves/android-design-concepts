# MY SAMPLE WITH DESIGN CONCEPTS LEARNED SO FAR

# Layouts
## 1 - Custom filter layout with animations

I've tried to implement on my own the layout from the following Medium article from @nikhilpanju : https://medium.com/proandroiddev/complex-ui-animations-on-android-featuring-motionlayout-aa82d83b8660

During the implementation, everytime I found any difficulties, I look over his repository so I could understand the differences and learn.

I've tried to implement the same animation twice by using with "low level of abstraction" techniques the first time and with motion layout the second time

## 2 - Motion layout

Just some motion layout basics so I could understand the idea of applying these kind of animations.

# Build

The building is pretty straight forward like any other Android App ðŸ˜Š.
